## Introduction
This course enables students to understand the different issues involved in the design and implementation of a database system and to execute various database queries using SQL.

## Practical 1
Create the following tables with appropriate data types and constraints:
- **Employee** (Emp_name, Street, City)
- **Work** (Emp_name, Cmp_name, Salary)
- **Company** (Cmp_name, City)
- **Manager** (Emp_name, Man_name)

## Practical 2
Perform various SQL queries to manage and manipulate the data in the tables created in Practical 2.

## Practical 3
Simple SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data from various tables such as `BORROW`, `CUSTOMERS`, `BRANCH`, etc.

## Practical 4
SQL queries using the `LIKE` operator to filter and retrieve data based on specific patterns in the data.

## Practical 5
SQL queries utilizing aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `COUNT`) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations.

## Practical 6
SQL queries involving table joins to retrieve data from multiple tables based on related columns.

## Practical 7
Miscellaneous SQL queries for various complex data retrieval and manipulation tasks.

## Practical 8
Advanced SQL queries and PL/SQL blocks for various complex operations such as finding average rates, loan details, customer information, etc.
